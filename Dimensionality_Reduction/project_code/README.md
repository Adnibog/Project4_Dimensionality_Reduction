# Dimensionality_Reduction Project

## Overview
This project applies PCA for dimensionality reduction and classification methods for face recognition using the AT&T face database.

## Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
1. Load the dataset:
    ```bash
    python load_data.py
    ```
2. Perform PCA and reconstruct faces:
    ```bash
    python reconstruct_faces.py
    ```
3. Train and evaluate classifiers:
    ```bash
    python classification.py
    ```
4. Apply additional dimensionality reduction methods:
    ```bash
    python additional_methods.py
    ```
